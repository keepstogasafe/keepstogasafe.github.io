# Keep Stoga Safe

## FAQ

> "When is the sit-in?"

The school administration has asked us to hold off until a later date, check back later here or on our insta [`@stogasafe`](https://www.instagram.com/stogasafe/) for more info.

> "How do I participate in the sit-in?"

Email your teacher that period and ask them for permission beforehand, then come to the atrium at the soon to be designated time.
